                 Height predicting model made at FAST National University-NUCES NUCES, karachi
# Description
Linear Algebra is basic of machine learning.Me with my group memmbers developed height predicting model using polynomial regressionand then implement it in form of cricket game.You can download the octave [​here​](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/download).The game takes velocity and then predict the height, the formula used is mentioned later.

# Getting Sarted
## Dependencies ##
* Windows 10/Mac OS/Linux.

## Installing ##
* Made in Octave.
* Made in C#.
* Need all files in LA project for implementing in octave.
* Need all files in gamefiles for running the cricket game.
## Exexuting program ##
* Once all files are download, just compile and run the program.
## Features ##
